Auxiliary part for the diploma, on the topic Language features of verbalization of emotions in the crisis media discourse of 2020-2021



The empirical material for this study was the headlines of news texts posted on such information resources as 
the Russian News Agency (hereinafter RIA Novosti) and Rosbusinessconsult (hereinafter RBC) in Russian.

In total, the empirical material amounted to 8,052 text headings of articles, 
of which 142 were taken from RBC, and 7910 from RIA Novosti.


The following marked-up lexicons were used.
Productcenters, 2012 (https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Extraction-of-Russian-Sentiment-Lexicon-for-Product-Chetviorkin-Loukachevitch/e23b1430b3c4c4850db1336c5ba9c51c2084f29b?p2df)
Emolux, 2013 (https://paperswithcode.com/paper/crowdsourcing-a-word-emotion-association)
Chan-Skiena's Lexicon, 2014 (https://sites.google.com/site/datascienceslab/projects/multilingualsentiment)
LinisCrowd, 2016 (http://www.linis-crowd.org/)
RuSentiLex, 2017 (http://www.labinform.ru/pub/rusentilex/rusentilex_2017.txt)
SentiRusColl, 2019 (https://github.com/kotelnikov-ev/SentiRusColl)


At the moment, the code is under development and needs improvements.

Namely, the part with the calculation of the positive and negative marks for polarity positive, 
polatiry negative in the experiment with lexicons.

This error requires time and computing resources to solve it, but it does not affect the results of current research work,
since the purpose of the work is not to study the performance of various Russian lexicons, 
but study of the actual linguistic features of emotional states.


I hope for your attention and understanding. The code serves informational purposes and gives an idea of the overall picture of the study.
